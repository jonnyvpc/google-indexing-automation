```

## 4. Security Demo (3 minutes)

### Workload Identity Federation
```bash
# Show authentication flow
gcloud auth print-identity-token

# Demonstrate secure token exchange
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-identity-token)" \
  https://webhook-listener-1006205970987.us-east1.run.app/health
```

## 5. Performance Metrics (3 minutes)

### Show Real-time Stats
```bash
# Display recent performance
gcloud run services describe webhook-listener

# Show request latency
gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_run_revision" \
  --format="table(timestamp,jsonPayload.latency)"
```

## 6. Cost Analysis (2 minutes)
- Open Google Cloud Billing
- Show monthly costs
- Compare with traditional solutions

## 7. Q&A Preparation

### Common Questions
1. "How does it handle high volume?"

   - Show ranking improvements

### Demo Troubleshooting

If webhook fails:
```bash
# Check service health
curl https://webhook-listener-1006205970987.us-east1.run.app/health

# Verify logs
gcloud logging read "severity>=ERROR"

# Test manual request
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"slug": "test-post"}' \
